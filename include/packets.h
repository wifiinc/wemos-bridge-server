/**
 * @struct sensor_packet
 * @brief Union structure for the entire sensor packet.
 * @details This structure is used to encapsulate the different types of sensor packets that can be
 * sent and has the shape of a valid packet.
 *
 * It contains a sensor_header followed by a union of different sensor data types.
 * The union allows for different types of sensor data to be stored in the same memory location,
 * depending on the packet type.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```cpp
 * sensor_packet packet;
 * packet.header.length = sizeof(sensor_packet_generic);
 * packet.header.ptype = PacketType::DATA;
 * packet.data.generic.metadata.sensor_type = SensorType::BUTTON;
 * packet.data.generic.metadata.sensor_id = 1;
 *
 * // Accessing the packet data
 * if (packet.header.ptype == PacketType::DATA) {
 *     if (packet.data.generic.metadata.sensor_type == SensorType::BUTTON) {
 *         uint8_t sensor_id = packet.data.generic.metadata.sensor_id;
 *         // Process button press event for sensor_id
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * To use this structure to request data from the dashboard, you can set the ptype to DASHBOARD_GET
 * to indicate that you want to request data from the backend (wemos bridge). Then, you use a
 * sensor_packet_generic
 * to specify the type of sensor you want to request data for and the ID of that sensor.
 *
 * Example:
 * We want to request temperature data from the backend (wemos bridge) for sensor ID 1.
 *
 * ```cpp
 * sensor_packet packet;
 * packet.header.length = sizeof(sensor_packet_generic);
 * packet.header.ptype = PacketType::DASHBOARD_GET;
 * packet.data.generic.metadata.sensor_type = SensorType::TEMPERATURE;
 * packet.data.generic.metadata.sensor_id = 1;
 * ```
 *
 * The backend (wemos bridge) will then respond with a packet of type DASHBOARD_RESPONSE containing
 * the requested data. Following the correct type packet for this example would be a
 * sensor_packet_temperature.
 *
 * Example:
 * We want to change the color of an RGB light with ID 1 to red (255, 0, 0).
 *
 * ```cpp
 * sensor_packet packet;
 * packet.header.length = sizeof(sensor_packet_rgb_light);
 * packet.header.ptype = PacketType::DASHBOARD_POST;
 * packet.data.rgb_light.metadata.sensor_type = SensorType::RGB_LIGHT;
 * packet.data.rgb_light.metadata.sensor_id = 1;
 * packet.data.rgb_light.red_state = 255;
 * packet.data.rgb_light.green_state = 0;
 * packet.data.rgb_light.blue_state = 0;
 * ```
 *
 * @note The data field is a union that can hold different types of sensor data.
 * @ingroup Packets
